# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.3.1

* System dependencies: sqlite.

* Please run "bundle install" after download repo. 
* If you are using rvm, I have auto created gemset(article_gems) in code base. In that case run "gem install bundler" and then "bundle install".

* Database creation: rake db:migrate

* Database test population: rake db:seed
